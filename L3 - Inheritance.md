# Inheritance

### What is Inheritance?
**When an object or class is based on another class; where its features are from a parent class**
Types:
- Single Inheritance: A subclass inheriting the features of a single superclass / parent class
- Multiple Inheritance: A subclass inheriting the features of a multiple parent classes
- Multilevel Inheritance: A subclass inheriting the features of a multiple parent classes
- Inheritance can have an hierarchy (branching like a tree) and/or be a hybrid: mixing the types of inheritances

### What can you do with Inheritance?
- A child will receive all attributes and methods of the parent
- A child can then enhance itself with new attributes and new methods
- A child can **OVERRIDE** attributes and methods for its own liking/speciality

**If a child class inherits the parent class:**
- The child does not need a new __init__() method UNLESS it **requires new attributes**
- The child does not need to reinstate the parentâ€™s methods UNLESS you override them
